    <description>FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically. The programmer provides
a specification of the program, in the form of properties which functions, methods
or objects should satisfy, and FsCheck then tests that the properties hold in a
large number of randomly generated cases.

While writing the properties, you are actually writing a testable specification of your program.

Specifications are expressed in F#, C# or VB, using combinators defined
in the FsCheck library. FsCheck provides combinators to define properties,
observe the distribution of test data, and define test data generators.
When a property fails, FsCheck automatically displays a minimal counter example.</description>
    <summary>FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically using randomly generated test cases.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Add Gen.growingElements.
Add default generator and shrinker for IPAddress and MailAddress.
Gen.eval now uses the given size directly to generate an element of that size, instead of randomly choosing a size up to the given size. This means that on average
test case sizes are bigger.
Gen.frequency now throws a clearer exeption if no element can be generated.
Renamed Gen.suchThat and Gen.suchThatOption to Gen.where or Gen.filter and Gen.tryWhere or Gen.tryFilter. (The functions/methods with the old names are still there, they are just marked Obsolete and will be removed in a future version.)
Renamed DontSize to DoNotSize, DontShrink to DoNotShrink, DontSizeInt16 to DoNotSizeInt16 etc. (The types with the old names are still there, they are just marked Obsolete and will be removed in a future version.)
StateMachine: operation shrinker shrinks operations too, not just the list of operations.</releaseNotes>
